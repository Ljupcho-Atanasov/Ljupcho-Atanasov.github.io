1. **Short Bio:**
   - I've had a long, fruitful, and fun career in the Dance industry since a very young age. Along the way learned to be a team player, leader, effective communicator, structured and demanding teacher and project manager including group projects involving 30+ people. Proud of my vast artistic creativity through my original choreography and found a very important pragmatic place for it in any problem-solving challenges.

2. **Fun fact:**
   - I used to do a lot of stand-up comedy until COVID-19 hit. By then I started getting bookings and was performing and hosting comedy shows around the city. I haven’t gone back to it since I committed to obtaining my computer science bachelor’s degree.
