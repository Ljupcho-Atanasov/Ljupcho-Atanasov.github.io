1. **Short Bio:**
   - I've been fortunate enough to have a long, fruitful, and fun career in the dance industry since a very young age after being a national ballroom champion for a little less than a decade. Along the way I learned to be a team player, diligent and hard worker, effective communicator, leader, structured and demanding teacher and project manager including group projects involving 30+ people. I am proud of my vast artistic creativity acquired and rendered through my original choreography in countless dance projects. Most importantly, I found a very important pragmatic usage for it in any problem-solving challenge.

         > **Fun fact:**
            *- I used to do a lot of stand-up comedy until COVID-19 hit. By then I started getting bookings and was performing and hosting comedy shows around the city. I haven’t gone back to it since I committed to obtaining my computer science bachelor’s degree.*
